 * Slightly modified code from opensensemap.org.                        *
 * Some variable names and Parameters have been changed to make it      *
 * work with the OpenNOX Station.                                       *
 * Putting the code into a cpp file causes some problems with the       *
 * Arduino IDE (it apears that the IDE has a Problem with the long      *
 * string used for storing the webpage)                                 *
